  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>This concludes my first coding project, kept it pretty simple, learned how to add clickable images that lead into videos, also added images side by side, bullet points with a list, headers, etc.
  I would love to end this by saying im excited to start this new journey as a Software Engineer; These images are a glimpse of what the future holds, I would love to travel the country with my family and hopefully give 
  them a better lifestyle. Before this I used to work construction, although this is definetly a huge career change nothing is impossible and I hope to one day be GREAT at what I do in this field and once again I'm excited to be 
  here in Flatiron, THANK YOU!
